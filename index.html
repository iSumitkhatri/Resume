        <li>Experiential Learning</li>
        <p>Made an economical merry-go-round miniature which runs on the kinetic energy generated by children while playing and generates electricity that can be used to power nearby facilities. We re-created and re-designed a merry-go-round that converts mechanical energy from human production into electricity to charge a USB device. The old design used casters which caused high friction loss and made the merry-go-round hard to spin. Our design includes a new Lazy Susan bearing  which made the merry-go-round much easier to spin. Our project turns the dynamo generators producing an electrical output charging a battery. The battery will be in an array for the DC house which can be stored for future energy absorption. We were focused on third-world villages or impoverished areas in this project. Our model would provide an energy source for villages off the grid, who can not afford to deliver energy to power their homes. The production costs will take over producing at generation plants and delivering to remote areas for the duration of the product's lifetime.</p>
